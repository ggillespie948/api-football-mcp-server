### üö® API Rate Limit Status

**Current Issue**: Getting 403/429 errors from API Football
- **403 Forbidden**: API key issue or subscription problem
- **429 Too Many Requests**: Daily limit exceeded on shared allocation

**Solutions**:
1. **Check API key**: Verify it's correct in .env file
2. **Check subscription**: Ensure API Football subscription is active
3. **Wait for reset**: If other app used up daily allocation
4. **Test with cached data**: System works without API calls

### üéØ NEXT ACTIONS

#### Option 1: Test API Key
```bash
# Verify your API key works
curl -H "x-rapidapi-key: YOUR_KEY" \
     -H "x-rapidapi-host: api-football-v1.p.rapidapi.com" \
     "https://api-football-v1.p.rapidapi.com/v3/status"
```

#### Option 2: Test with Mock Data
```bash
# Test system with mock data (no API calls)
python tests/test_with_database.py
```

#### Option 3: Wait and Retry
If the other app used up today's allocation, wait until tomorrow and the system will automatically work.
